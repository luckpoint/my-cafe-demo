I need to add a "This week Special" label to menu items in my coffee shop app.

Requirements:
- Check if each product has a "flag" field in the data
- If the flag value is "This week Special", display a special badge/label on that product card
- The label should be visually prominent and clearly show "This week Special"
- The label should be positioned on the product card (e.g., top-left or top-right corner)

Data structure example:
{
  "id": "1",
  "name": "Caffè Latte",
  "category": "coffee",
  "description": "Rich espresso balanced with steamed milk...",
  "price": {...},
  "image": "...",
  "flag": "This week Special"
}

Please implement this feature with appropriate styling that stands out but maintains the overall design aesthetic.

Additional styling preferences:
- Use a distinctive green color for the special label
- Only show the label when the flag field exists and has the value "This week Special"
